### Welcome
I'm Charles - a computational (and sometimes theoretical) physicist with experience developing electronic structure codes, exploring model Hamiltonians, and simulating a wide swath of atomic excitations. I spend most of my time in high performance computing environments where I am constantly asking myself how to fit more jobs onto the same number of CPUs. I like to tinker around with software, which is a nice way of saying that I enjoy to spending 5 hours automating a task that takes 5 minutes.

I received my BS in Physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta with a minor in French. My early research interests were a bit scattered, with a few short stints in high energy and experimental condensed matter physics. After Covid forced science online I found my calling on the computational side of condensed matter where I can explore the physics I am interested in with meticulous control and arbitrary precision.

I have recently recieved my PhD in Condensed Matter Physics from The University of Washington in Seattle, under the advisement of Gerald T. Seidler and John J. Rehr. My research centered around computational and theoretical methods for treating x-ray spectroscopy, a powerful tool for explaining all sorts of atomic, electronic, and material properties. <a href="thesis" target="_blank">My thesis</a> was about first-principles approach to core-to-core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES), focusing on highly correlated 3d-transition metals.

I work extensively with Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, ect) and Mathematica for data analysis, with some moderate use of Lua and C++ for scripting and development of new electronic structure software. In all aspects of my work, I focus on clear and thorough representation of data, with significant effort being put towards finding interesting ways of visualizing information to better tell a complete story.
