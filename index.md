### Welcome
I'm Charles - a computational (and sometimes theoretical) physicist with experience developing electronic structure codes, exploring model Hamiltonians, and simulating a wide swath of atomic excitations. I spend most of my time in high performance computing environments where I am constantly asking myself how to fit more jobs onto the same number of CPUs. I like to tinker around with software, which is a nice way of saying that I enjoy to spending 5 hours automating a task that takes 5 minutes.

I received my BS in Physics from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta with a minor in French. My early research interests were a bit scattered, with a few short stints in high energy and experimental condensed matter physics. After Covid forced science online I found my calling on the computational side of condensed matter where I can explore the physics I am interested in with meticulous control and arbitrary precision.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in Condensed Matter Physics at The University of Washington in Seattle, under the advisement of Gerald T. Seidler and John J. Rehr. My research centers around x-ray spectroscopy as a powerful tool for explaining all sorts of atomic, electronic, and material properties. My thesis topic is a first-principles approach to core-to-core X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (XES), focusing on highly correlated 3d-transition metals. 

I work extensively with Python (numpy, scipy, pandas, matplotlib, tensorflow, ect) and Mathematica for data analysis, with some moderate use of Lua and C++ for scripting and development of new electronic structure software. In all aspects of my work, I focus on clear and thorough representation of data, with significant effort being put towards finding interesting ways of visualizing information to better tell a complete story.
